# Weather by GeoLocation

This application was built to showcase the style in which I write code in an MVC structure.

I spent approximately 1.5 hours reading through the CakePHP documentation to compare its setup to the MVC frameworks I have worked with in the past.

I spent about 2 hours putting the app together, including styling.
